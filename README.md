# Angular 2 Hangman Game#

----------

The Hangman word-guessing game hits a nice sweet spot when learning a new computer language. Not as trivial as "Hello World" but not overly difficult to implement.

This version of Hangman was written utilizing the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language, version 2.0 and the [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) framework.

## Prerequisites

This project needs [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the node package manager (npm).  Currently node is at version 6.9.4 and npm 3.10.10. Grab the MSI installer at [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/). This also installs npm.

## Getting Started

This project was generated with a beta version of [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).  Follow the angular-cli directions for installing but basically:

	npm install -g angular-cli

From the Hangman project root directory, install *node* modules using:
	
	npm install  

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
